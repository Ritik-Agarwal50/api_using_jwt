=======
This is the basic API for the TODO list. It has 4 endpoints: 
1. GET /todos - get all todos
2. POST /todos - create new todo
3. DELETE /todos/:id - delete todo by id 
4. Update /todos/:id - update todo by id 

What we have Used?
--> We have used Go Lang to create a normal CRUD API. 
We are supabase to perform all those actions. 

What Next? 
--> I will also try to implement the JWT(JSON Web Token) on top of this. 

--> I will try to implement Docker on it. We will try to create an image of it and  will containerize that image so that we can use that image remotely.
