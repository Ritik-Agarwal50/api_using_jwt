This is the basic API for the TODO list. It has 4 endpoints: <br>
1. GET /todos - get all todos<br>
2. POST /todos - create new todo<br>
3. DELETE /todos/:id - delete todo by id <br>
4. Update /todos/:id - update todo by id <br>
<br>
What we have Used?<br>
--> We have used Go Lang to create a normal CRUD API. <br>
We are supabase to perform all those actions. <br>
<br>
What Next? <br>
--> I will also try to implement the JWT(JSON Web Token) on top of this. <br>
<br>
--> I will try to implement Docker on it. We will try to create an image of it and  will containerize that image so that we can use that image remotely. <br>
